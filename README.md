# How to create a meme compilation

1. Grab all the meme clips you want for the compilation and place them in the src folder.
Make sure they are all the same file type (by default it is mp4 files. you can change this in the script)

2. Create a 1280x720 background image in Photoshop or similar photo editing software. Replace the Background.png file in the src folder
with your image.

3. Open the mcm.bat file and it should do the rest of the work for you.
Once it is complete, it will be in the src folder under the name 'output.mp4'.
